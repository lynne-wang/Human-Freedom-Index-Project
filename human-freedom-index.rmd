```{r packages-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
hfi <- read_csv("data/hfi_cc_2019.csv") 
```

```{r glimpse}
glimpse(hfi)
```

### Question 1

How has overall freedom around the world changed over time?

```{r q1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
hfscore_by_year <- hfi %>% 
  filter(hf_score != "-") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hf = mean(as.numeric(hf_score)))

ggplot(data = hfscore_by_year, 
       aes(x = as.factor(year), y = mean_hf, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(stat = "identity") +
  ylim(6.75, 7.25)
```

### Question 2

How has overall freedom in the U.S. and China changed over time?

```{r q2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
hfscore_china_us <- hfi %>% 
  filter(hf_score != "-" & 
           (countries == "China" | countries == "United States")) %>% 
  group_by(year, countries) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hf = mean(as.numeric(hf_score)))

ggplot(data = hfscore_china_us, 
       aes(x = as.factor(year), y = mean_hf, group = countries, color = countries)) +
  geom_line(stat = "identity")
```
